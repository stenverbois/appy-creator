            The editor is used to create the visual part of your application.
            On your left you have a list of components. With these components you create the application that you want.
            When you click on a component, the component will be visible on the smartphone panel in the middle.
          </p>

          <p>
            When a component is selected on the smartphone panel, you can move it around by just dragging it to where you want.
            You can also resize the component if you want to. You do this by putting your cursor in the right bottom corner of the component.
            Then you just drag to the size you want. <b>ZET GIF HIER ERGENS</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            On the right side of the editor you have the properties section. Here you can edit the properties of the components on the smartphone panel individually.
            More info about the components and their properties can be found in the <a href="#components">components</a> section.
            In this section you can also delete a component by clicking on the <kbd>DELETE</kbd> button at the bottom of the panel.
          </p>

          <img class="responsive-img" src="img/editor/tabs.png">
          <p>On the top bar of the editor you have a few tabs. We are now in the Design tab.
            When you're done with your design you can choose to add some logic to your app by going to the Logic tab.
            More info about the logic tab can be found in the <a href="#logic">logic</a> section.
            The info tab contains info about the application itself but you shouldn't worry about that for the moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also save your app by clicking on the save tab. Once saved you can reload the app with the load tab.
            If you're done with making your app, you can upload it to the public by clicking on upload.
            When you do this you'll get a QR code back. This QR code is important! Other users will use this to download your application.

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <img class="responsive-img" src="img/logic/logic.png">
        <p>
          The logic view is the view where you create the logic of your application.
          This is an important process because it makes your app do the things you want!
          The logic view consists of two main area's. First we again have a side bar on the left.
          This time there is a button for every component that is present in your app.
          Here you can also find functions. These functions are the most important things in your logic because they will connect
          your components to make them do useful things.
          When you click on one of the components or functions, a block will appear on the right side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inputs of a block are indicated by the colored circles and outputs by the empty circles.
          You can connect any input to an output simply by holding your mouse down on an output and then releasing
          it over an input.
        </p>
        <h4>Functions</h4>
        <p>
          Functions consist of three different types of inputs and outputs.
          At the left side of the block you always have the inputs of the function.
          These inputs are given to the function to do something with.
          The inputs always have names so be sure to carefully read the label of the input you want to make a connection with.
          On the bottom of the block you have an action input.
          These inputs should only be connected with connections from a Button block.
          The reason for this is that your function is triggered by an event (e.g. <u>click</u> on a button).
          For the moment only buttons have events.
          On the right side of the function block you have the output's of the function.
          These outputs can be connected with any other component or even function.

                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Special note: The left output is used first. So if you connect a textbox with text "A" to left and a textbox with text "B" to right.
              The result will be "AB" and not "BA".</p>

            The next two function blocks are a bit different because they are not always available.
            They have an effect on a specific List component in your app, so you will only be able to
            add one of them for each List component you have in your app.

            <p>
              When activated, the AddListItem block adds a new item to the list it belongs to.
              It doesn't have a fixed set of inputs like the Plus, rather the inputs
              depend on what components you have put in the list item need an input.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example: If you have two Labels and a Button in your list item
              then the AddListItem block will only have two inputs, one for each label.
              the button does't need an input in this case. You provided the text on the button
              when designing the list item. It will then make a new item with the text of the connected
              inputs in place of the default text on those Labels.
            </p>

            <p>
              When activated, the RemoveListItem block removes an item from the list it belongs to.
              For now, you can only remove items from lists by clicking on a button on that item.
              So the way you this function is by connecting a Button to it that is part of the components of a list item.
