        <h3>Tutorial</h3>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>
            Lets's dive right in with a small tutorial to make your first app! If you just want to know how a
            specific part of the editor works, feel free to use the menu on the right to skip to the part you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will be making an app that lets a user fill in two textboxes and then press a button to combine the text
            in those textboxes and show the result. Let's get started!
          </p>
          <h5>Design</h5>
          <p>
            First thing we need to do is add all the components we need to our app. For this small app we will need
            two textboxes for the user to fill in the text, one button and a label to show the resulting text.
            We add these components by clicking on them in de components bar on the left.
            You can position and resize the elements to make your app look unique. You can change some of
            the properties of the components as well, like the text on the button or the default text in the textboxes.
          </p>
          <img class="responsive-img wide" data-gifffer="img/editor/design.gif">
          <p>
            Now that we have all the components in place we can apply some logic to them.
          </p>
          <h5>Logic</h5>
          <p>
            To go to the logic page, click on the logic tab in the header bar (see gif right under this text).
            Now we start by looking through the functions on the left. Click on the <b>Plus</b> block and you will see
            a logic block appear in the middle of the screen. This is the central logic block for our app.
          </p>
          <img class="responsive-img wide" data-gifffer="https://i.gyazo.com/4eb40535f280f7346379ef5422a92847.gif">
          (Click on the image to play the gif or to stop the gif!)
          <p>
            We can see it needs some inputs, an output and an action. The inputs are the textboxes, so we find both our
            textboxes in the bar on the left and add them to the logic screen by clicking on them. Now we can connect
            the <b>text</b> output of the textboxes to the <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> inputs of the Plus block.
          </p>
          <img class="responsive-img wide" data-gifffer="https://i.gyazo.com/c17d26eda46cdfd4e338d5a051245998.gif">
          <p>
            Next up is the output. We add the label to the logic screen and connect the output of the Plus block to
            the <b>text</b> input of the label.
          </p>
          <img class="responsive-img wide" data-gifffer="https://i.gyazo.com/274fe3eddcbea4603235a00e73a4b517.gif">
          <p>
            Finally we need a way to activate the Plus block. Let's add our last component, the button, to the logic screen
            and connect it with the <b>action</b> input of the Plus block. On the connection you will see
            a dropdown selection for the action that will activate the block. For now we need the click so you can leave it
            like that. That's it! All we need to do now is click the Upload button in the top right corner, scan the qr code with
            the Appy Center app and see our brand new app in action.
          </p>
          <img class="responsive-img wide" data-gifffer="https://i.gyazo.com/0cf4716d49461a0746c041839bf3526a.gif">
          <p>
            Now it's time to see our app in action after we've uploaded it to the server and downloaded it to our smartphone!
            Your app should do something like this:
            <img class="responsive-img wide" data-gifffer="https://i.gyazo.com/bda43d0f4a9b42e73c24d25351571814.gif" data-gifffer-width="208" data-gifffer-height="372">

          <img class="responsive-img wide" src="img/editor/editor.png">
          <p>
            The editor is used to create the visual part of your application.
            On your left you have a list of components. With these components you create the application that you want.
            When you click on a component, the component will be visible on the smartphone panel in the middle.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a component is selected on the smartphone panel, you can move it around by just dragging it to where you want.
            You can also resize the component if you want to. You do this by putting your cursor in the right bottom corner of the component.
            Then you just drag to the size you want.
          </p>
          <img class="responsive-img wide" data-gifffer="https://i.gyazo.com/b605a02fe2affee9c16c4de872b795cc.gif">
          <p>
            On the right side of the editor you have the properties section. Here you can edit the properties of the components on the smartphone panel individually.
            More info about the components and their properties can be found in the <a href="#components">components</a> section.
            In this section you can also delete a component by clicking on the <kbd>DELETE</kbd> button at the bottom of the panel.
          </p>
          <img class="responsive-img" src="img/editor/tabs.png">
          <p>On the top bar of the editor you have a few tabs. We are now in the Design tab.
            When you're done with your design you can choose to add some logic to your app by going to the Logic tab.
            More info about the logic tab can be found in the <a href="#logic">logic</a> section.
            The info tab contains info about the application itself but you shouldn't worry about that for the moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also save your app by clicking on the save tab. Once saved you can reload the app with the load tab.
            If you're done with making your app, you can upload it to the public by clicking on upload.
            When you do this you'll get a QR code back. This QR code is important! Other users will use this to download your application.

        <p>
          The logic view is the view where you create the logic of your application.
          This is an important process because it makes your app do the things you want!
          The logic view consists of two main area's. First we again have a side bar on the left.
          This time there is a button for every component that is present in your app.
          Here you can also find functions. These functions are the most important things in your logic because they will connect
          your components to make them do useful things.
          When you click on one of the components or functions, a block will appear on the right side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inputs of a block are indicated by the colored circles and outputs by the empty circles.
          You can connect any input to an output simply by holding your mouse down on an output and then releasing
          it over an input.
        </p>
        <div class="card-panel teal">
          <p class="white-text">
            <i>Note:</i> When you add a List component to the logic screen, instead of adding a single block like for the other components,
            there will a block for every component inside each list item. This way you can connect these with functions individually.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Functions</h4>
        <p>
          Functions consist of three different types of inputs and outputs.
          At the left side of the block you always have the inputs of the function.
          These inputs are given to the function to do something with.
          The inputs always have names so be sure to carefully read the label of the input you want to make a connection with.
          On the bottom of the block you have an action input.
          These inputs should only be connected with connections from a Button block.
          The reason for this is that your function is triggered by an event (e.g. <u>click</u> on a button).
          For the moment only buttons have events.
          On the right side of the function block you have the output's of the function.
          These outputs can be connected with any other component or even function.

            <p>Special note: The left output is used first. So if you connect a textbox with text "A" to left and a textbox with text "B" to right.
              The result will be "AB" and not "BA".</p>

            The next two function blocks are a bit different because they are not always available.
            They have an effect on a specific List component in your app, so you will only be able to

            <p>
              When activated, the AddListItem block adds a new item to the list it belongs to.
              It doesn't have a fixed set of inputs like the Plus, rather the inputs
              depend on what components you have put in the list item need an input.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example: If you have two Labels and a Button in your list item
              then the AddListItem block will only have two inputs, one for each label.
              the button does't need an input in this case. You provided the text on the button
              when designing the list item. It will then make a new item with the text of the connected
              inputs in place of the default text on those Labels.

              When activated, the RemoveListItem block removes an item from the list it belongs to.
              For now, you can only remove items from lists by clicking on a button on that item.
              So the way you this function is by connecting a Button to it that is part of the components of a list item.
